Modify hypertuner.py to the tickers and allocations you like (its there to be hacked).
Run it and then enter values on: https://testfol.io (make sure to set quarterly rebalancing) and reenter the sharpe ratio and max drawdown.
Then setup reoccuring investments with your chosen ratio.
Lastly, modify rebalance.py and enter your chosen allocation values.
Use the script to quarterly rebalance to make some money on mean-reversing.
